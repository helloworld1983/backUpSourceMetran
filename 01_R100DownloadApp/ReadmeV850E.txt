This setup tool was changed for V850E:
- Download with 38000Kbps baud Uart
- Increase the delay time for waiting the FlashRom on V850e.
(The size of Flash is 4MB, so the time for erasing is longer.)
- Using some new pictures.

You can open Setup.dsw to edit this project by using Microsoft Visual C++ 6.
